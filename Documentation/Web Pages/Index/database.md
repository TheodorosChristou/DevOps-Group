# dbConnect Utility

The `dbConnect` utility is a module responsible for connecting to a MongoDB database using the Mongoose library. It ensures a single database connection is shared across multiple requests in a Next.js application.

## Usage

To use this utility, import it into your Next.js application.

```tsx
import dbConnect from '../path/to/dbConnect';

// Example usage
await dbConnect();
```

## Utility Functionality

The dbConnect utility uses Mongoose to connect to a MongoDB database with the provided connection URI (MONGODB_URI). It caches the database connection to improve performance and prevent redundant connections.

```tsx
import mongoose from 'mongoose';

mongoose.set('strictQuery', true);

const MONGODB_URI = process.env.MONGODB_URI!;
```

## Configuration
Ensure that the MONGODB_URI environment variable is defined in your .env.local file.

```tsx
.env.local
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_uri
```

## Connection Caching
The utility uses a global caching mechanism to store the database connection and promise. If a connection is already established, it returns the existing connection; otherwise, it creates a new connection.

```
let cached = global.mongoose;

```

## Buffering Commands

The utility configures Mongoose to not buffer commands, which can be useful in certain scenarios.

```tsx
const opts = {
  bufferCommands: false,
};

```

## Error Handling

The utility catches any errors that occur during the connection process, resets the promise, and throws the error.

```tsx
try {
  cached.conn = await cached.promise;
} catch (e) {
  cached.promise = null;
  throw e;
}

return cached.conn;
```
This dbConnect utility is designed to be a robust and performant solution for connecting to a MongoDB database in a Next.js application.
