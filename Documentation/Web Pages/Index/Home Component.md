# Home Component

The `Home` component is a React component responsible for rendering the index page based on the user's session information. It includes logic for handling different user roles and displaying map-related information.

## Usage

To use this component, import it into your React application.

```tsx
import Index from '../path/to/Index';

// Example usage
const HomePage = () => <Index Map={/* pass the Map data */} sess={/* pass the session data */} />;
```

## Component Functionality

The Index component dynamically renders content based on the user's role and session information.

```tsx
import axios from 'axios';
import { useTranslation } from 'react-i18next';
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function Index({ Map, sess }) {
  // ... (Rest of the code)
}
```

## Dependencies

- axios: A library for making HTTP requests.

- react-i18next: A popular internationalization library for React.

- useState: A React hook for managing state.

## State

The component uses the useState hook to manage the state of the map data.

```tsx
const [mapState, setmapState] = useState(map.Map);
```

## User and Role Information

The component extracts user and role information from the session.
```tsx
const session = sess;
let user, role;

if (session?.user?.name?.toString()) {
  user = session.user.name;
  role = session.user.role;
}
```

## Handling Deletion

The handleDelete function deletes a map entry when the corresponding button is clicked.

```tsx
const handleDelete = async (id) => {
  await axios.delete(`/api/changes/${id}`);
  setmapState(mapState.filter((r, _i) => r._id !== id));
};
```

## Rendering Content

The component dynamically renders content based on the user's role and session information.

```tsx
return (
  <div className="mt-10 mb-10">
    {/* ... (Rest of the code) */}
  </div>
);
```

## Additional Notes

The component includes conditional rendering based on the user's role.
For admin users, it displays a list of map entries with options to delete or update them.
For regular users, it displays a welcome message.
If there is no active session, it prompts the user to sign in.
This Index component is designed to provide a personalized home page experience based on the user's role and session information.
