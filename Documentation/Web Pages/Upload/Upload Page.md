# Upload Page

This React component, named `Upload`, is designed to dynamically import and render another component named `Uploading` using Next.js dynamic imports. It utilizes the `dynamic` function from `next/dynamic` to load the `Uploader` component lazily, meaning it won't be included in the server-side rendering (SSR) process.

## Usage

To use this component, you can import it in your TypeScript React application and include it in your JSX.

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import dynamic from 'next/dynamic';

export default function Upload() {
  // Dynamically import the Uploading component with client-side rendering
  const Uploader = dynamic(() => import('../components/Uploading'), { ssr: false });

  // Render the dynamically imported Uploading component
  return <Uploader />;
}
```
